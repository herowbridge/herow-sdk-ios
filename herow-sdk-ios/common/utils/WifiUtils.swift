/**
 * Manages to check if the wifi (hardware) is enable, don't give any information
 * about the connectivity. To do this, we use a "hack". When there's TWO interfaces
 * reported by getifaddrs() with the name "awdl0" then WiFi is enabled. Just one and it's disabled.
 * If you're using the Command Center, in iOS 11, that's only "soft off." The wifi is disable temporary.
 * It'll turn it self back on by the next morning. "Hard off" only happens when turning off via Settings app.
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41969989/better-way-to-detect-wifi-enabled-disabled-on-ios
